For this assignment we were tasked with visualizing geoJson data with Leaflet. Mapbox was used for the base layers of the map while the earthquake data was taken from the USGS (United States Geological Survey).

Leaflet-Step-1
Located in this folder you will find the CSS, JavaScript and index file for the first portion of the assignment. Requirements for this assignment were as follows:

Visualize an earthquake dataset from [USGS Past 7 Days - All EarthQuakes] (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
Markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes by their size and depth (opacity of marker).
Create a legend which provides context for the map data
Leaflet-Step-2
In addition to the above the following was requested for the second step:

For the second part of the homework, dataset from [Tectonic Plate Data] (https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)
This has multiple maps to choose from.
